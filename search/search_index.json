Once the app gets a web request (the link above is clicked), it will wake up, but the initial response can take 10-20 seconds About These tools aim to provide a reproducible and consistent data visualisation platform where experimental and computational researchers can use big data and statistical analysis to explore their data or the adsorption related data we provide to find the best materials for specific applications. Improving from the original Metal-organic Framework (MOF) Explorer, this tool now allows individuals to upload their own data set to analyse data in a 2D and 3D environment, filter data through the interactive data table and also perform statistical analysis on top performing structures. Figure 1: Screenshot of tool in use Data File Requirements The data file to upload must meet the following requirements: 1. A .xlsx, .csv or a .txt data file must be uploaded. Please note that large .xlsx files take time to process so .csv or .txt files are preferred. 2. The uploaded datasheet must have the structure name or identifier on its first column (shown in table 1). 3. The uploaded datasheet must be completely populated (no blank cells). Blank cells can be replaced to \u20180\u2019 using the \u2018Replace All\u2019 function in Excel 4. If required, data must be transposed so that there is a single column stating the variables simulated with a column of the pressures used. Example data files before e.g. AAML_Oxygen_Raw_Data.csv and after transposition AAML_Oxygen_Data.csv can be found here 5. For the MOF Explorer Animation, pressures for the pressure frame must have the column heading \u2018Pressure\u2019. Include this column even if your data does not have multiple pressures and state the pressure your simulation has run on. 6. If you have the Structure Groupings (MOF families for example) in your dataset, the column must have the heading \u2018Family\u2019 (shown in table 1). Example files showing datasets before and after being transposed can be seen in the GitHub repository . Excels formatting capabilities, Bash and Python were used to transpose and fit aforementioned files to the above criteria. Table 1: Example File Upload DDEC code Family Pressure Grav.

Figure 3: Pan feature Zoom modes If the plot\u2019s mode is set to \u2018Zoom\u2019, click and drag on the plot to zoom-in and double click to zoom-out completely. i.e. auto scale of both axis. The user can also zoom in and out by clicking on the + and \u2013 buttons. Axes labels will automatically optimize as you zoom in. Figure 4: Auto scale of both axis (Zoom) Reset axes One can also drag the x and y axis in a horizontal and vertical motion respectively to move along the length of the axis (Figure 3). Clicking \u2018Reset axes\u2019 will reset the axes. Figure 5: Reset axis Hover options One of these two buttons is selected at all times. Clicking \u2018Show closest data on hover\u2019 will display the data for just one point under the cursor. Clicking \u2018Compare data on hover\u2019 will show you the data for all points with the same x-value. Figure 6: Hover options Functions found on 3D Plots As well as the icons found in 2D plots, 3D plots also have the following icons to assist with data exploration. The mode bar for 3D charts gives you additional options for controlling rotations and also lets you toggle between the default view and your last saved view. Orbital rotation Orbital Rotation rotates the plot around its middle point in 3-Dimensional space. Figure 7: Orital Rotation Turntable rotation Turntable Rotation rotates the plot around its middle point while constraining the z-axis slightly. Figure 8: Turntable Rotation Reset camera position to default Clicking Reset Camera to Default zooms back to the default position at 45 degrees from all axes. Figure 9: Reset Camera to default Reset camera position to last save Clicking Reset Camera to Last Save zooms it to the last saved position as set in the Organize view. Figure 10: Reset Camera to last save MOF Explorer Animation Auto scaling animations With all animations, auto range in frames is currently not supported in Plotly. Therefore, the user must slide the maximum pressure frame and press the auto scale button on the toolbar at the top right side of the plot. The user can then press play and the range will auto scale automatically. Figure 11: Auto scale button 2D Animation Environment The 2D Animation Environment provides a 2, 3, and 4 Dimensional variable environment to explore specific structures against pressure to find the best materials for the users applications. Pressing the \u20182\u2019, \u20183\u2019, \u20184\u2019 tab plots a 2D, 3D and 4D variable environment respectively. Populate ALL the dropdowns to produce your plot. The tab of the dashboard will be \u2018Updating\u2026\u2019 and then return to \u2018Dash\u2019 once your command has been fully executed. Clicking Play and pause will play and pause your animation respectively. You can also use the slider to pause the animation at a specific pressure. Zoom in animation tools Double clicking on one structure will result in the plot focussing on said single structure. Running the animation will allow you to see the focussed structure during the animation frame. To return the standard plot double click the plot. Figure 12: Zoom in tool 3D Animation Environment The 3D Animation Environment provides a 5-Dimensional variable environment to explore specific structures against pressure to find the best materials for the users applications. Populate ALL the dropdowns to produce your plot. The tab of the dashboard will be \u2018Updating\u2026\u2019 and then return to \u2018Dash\u2019 once your command has been fully executed. Clicking Play and pause will play and pause your animation respectively. You can also use the slider to pause the animation at a specific pressure. MOF Data Filtering Using the sorting and filtering data table, users are able to filter variables from their dataset to produce plots of their preference. All variables in the users dataset can be sorted, filtered and deleted in the interactive data table. The user can select and delete certain columns according to their preference. The arguments that the data table can take are specified below. After filtering there are options to choose a logarithmic or linear axis scale, and choose a color scale of choice from the viridis color palette. Interactive data table Figure 13: Interactive Data table Populate ALL the dropdowns and radio items to produce your plot. The tab of the dashboard will be \u2018Updating\u2026\u2019 and then return to \u2018Dash\u2019 once your command has been fully executed. Filtering plots using the data table The syntax for the data table can be seen in table 2. These criteria will filter both the data table that is present but also filter the data on your plot. For example, figure 11 shows the reproduced plot when the \u2018Pressure\u2019 column has the argument \u2018>50\u2019 and the \u2018Family\u2019 column has the argument \u2018ZIF\u2019. X and Y axis are linear and the \u2018Plasma\u2019 color scale is chosen. Figure 14: Data table plot example Table 2: Syntax for interactive data table Syntax Description > or gt (int) Values greater than the integer specified < or lt (int) Values less than the integer specified = or eq (str or int) Values equal to the string or integer specified in column x >= (int) or ge Values greater than or equal to the integer specified <= (int) or le Values less than or equal to the integer specified != or ne (int) Values not equal to the integer specified B (str) Values containing \u2018B\u2019 = \u201ccore-mof-ddec-1\u201d (str) Values equal to the string specified 1 contains (str) Values equal to the text value specified datestartswith \u2018yyyy-mm-dd 00:00\u2019 (dates and times only) Will match dates specified in the search. Can specify a particular, year, month, day or time. 1 If you have spaces or special characters (including -), these must be wrapped in quotes. Single quotes, double quotes, or backticks work. If you have quotes in the string, you can use a different quote, or escape the quote character. E.g. \u2018Hello \u201cThere\u201d! \u2019and \u201c Hello \\ \u201dThere! \\ \u201d \u201d Statistical Analysis of Top Structures All structures, or top performing structures (1%, 5% or 10% of all structures) can be analysed in accordance to a set variable decided by the user e.g. Deliverable Capacity. In the violin plot, geometric properties can then be analysed against pressure to determine Q1, Q3, IQR, mean, median, maximum and minimum points for a dataset of the users choice, alongside the distribution of MOFs in said violin plot. In the distribution plot, the number of structures against a variable in the users data frame can be analysed to determine the spread of structures in the users data. The user can also decide if they would like the absolute data or original data to be analysed. The distribution can be further filtered by MOF families (if the user has uploaded this information in its data frame). An animation feature is also available to view these frames in accordance to pressure. Violin Plot Figure 15: Violin plot Using the legend to interact with your plot The legend can be used to interact with the violin plots that are in the plot. Double clicking on a legend box will isolate the plot to said violin plot. Double clicking the legend will return the plot to the original plot. Figure 16: Violin plot single select Using the range slider to interact with your plot Figure 17: Violin plot range slider Single clicking on a desired legend box will remove the respective violin plot from the graph. Single click on the same pressure in the legend will add the violin plot back into the graph. Using the range slider (tool directly below the x-axis) can also isolate one or multiple violin plots. Dragging the left and right toggle will produce the same reflection that is on the range slider. Distrbution Plot Like mentioned in MOF Explorer Animations, with all animations, auto range in frames is currently not supported in Plotly. Therefore, the user must slide the maximum pressure frame and press the auto scale button on the toolbar at the top right side of the plot. The user can then press play and the range will auto scale automatically. The user must populate ALL the dropdowns and radio items to produce a graph. If the dataset uploaded does not provide the structures of families \u2018None\u2019 grouping will apply. The rugged plot above the histogram indicates the distribution of structures against the X variable selected. The histogram represents the X variable selected against the number of structures that apply.
